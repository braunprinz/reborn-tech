        "answer": "No. Anyone who does is lying. We guarantee systematic improvement in visibility and provide transparent reporting. Rankings depend on many factors outside anyone's control—competitor activity, algorithm changes, market dynamics. What we can guarantee is methodical work and measurable progress."

      {
        "question": "How long until I see results?",
        "answer": "Local visibility improvements typically begin within 4-8 weeks. Meaningful ranking changes take 3-6 months. Automation ROI is often immediate. We set realistic expectations upfront and provide monthly progress reports."

      {
        "question": "What's a realistic budget?",
        "answer": "Local growth starts around €800/month. Website projects range from €3,000-15,000 depending on complexity. Automation projects are scoped individually. We don't do discount work—you get senior expertise, not junior execution."

      },
      {
        "question": "Can you automate everything?",
        "answer": "No. Automation works best for repetitive, rule-based tasks. Creative decisions, complex negotiations, and edge cases still need humans. We help identify what should and shouldn't be automated."
