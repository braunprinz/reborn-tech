# Design Guidelines: Premium Bilingual Digital Agency

## Design Philosophy

**Core Mandate**: This must NOT be a standard agency website. Every section must feel engineered, not marketed. Calm, confident, precise—differentiated from generic agency templates.

**Visual Identity**: Dark, technical, premium. Boutique digital partner aesthetic, not marketing-first layout.

## Visual Design System

### Color Palette
- **Base**: Near-black or deep navy backgrounds
- **Text**: Off-white for primary content
- **Accent**: Single restrained accent (cyan/teal range) for emphasis
- **Treatment**: Soft gradients, glassy card effects
- **Shadows**: Subtle, refined depth

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Headlines**: Strong scale, confident, short statements
- **Body**: Calm, readable, generous line-height
- **Tone**: Engineered and technical, NOT playful or marketing-heavy
- **No**: Decorative fonts, script fonts, overly stylized typefaces

### Spacing & Layout
- **Whitespace**: Generous, intentional breathing room
- **Corners**: Rounded 2xl consistently
- **Density**: Calm, not cramped—allow content to breathe
- **Grid**: Clean, structured, asymmetric where appropriate

### Animation Philosophy
- **Motion**: Restrained, subtle, purposeful only
- **Transitions**: Smooth, micro-interactions that enhance understanding
- **NO**: Distracting effects, bouncing elements, excessive parallax
- **Interactive elements**: System loop visualization, map grid demo—both calm and functional

## Homepage Structure (Unique Non-Generic Blocks)

### Hero: System View
- Short, confident headline (not buzzword-heavy)
- System explanation subheadline
- **Right side**: Interactive System Loop Visual (Visibility → Website → Automation → Custom IT) with subtle motion
- **CTAs**: Primary "Request a Map Audit" + Secondary "Book Discovery Call"
- Large, editorial layout—NOT centered hero template

### Proof Strip
- Calm metric tiles (horizontal layout)
- Show: Map grid coverage, conversion uplift, hours saved via automation
- **NO**: Fake logos, inflated testimonials, client grids
- Understated confidence

### Four Pillars: Editorial Grid
- Large format, NOT icon boxes
- Each pillar: value statement + outcomes + link to detail page
- Layout: 2x2 grid on desktop, stacked mobile
- Glassy card treatment with hover depth

### Interactive Map Grid Demo
- Keyword selector + City selector
- Animated frontend visualization (clearly labeled as "Demo")
- Technical aesthetic—styled like a data dashboard
- Must feel like a tool, not a gimmick

### Method Timeline
- Visual timeline: Baseline & Audit → Build & Fix → Authority & Automation → Iterate & Measure
- Expandable sections with factual process details
- Horizontal flow on desktop, vertical on mobile
- Styled as engineering documentation

### Work Showcase
- Case simulations styled like technical reports
- Include clear disclaimers
- NOT blog-style cards—think documentation/case study format
- Dark cards with data visualizations or mockup screenshots

### FAQ Block
- Honest answers to tough questions (no ranking guarantees, timelines, budget reality)
- Accordion-style expandable
- NOT hidden at bottom—given prominence
- Builds trust through transparency

### Final CTA
- Minimal, confident
- NO pressure language or countdown timers
- Single focused action

## Service Detail Pages

### Layout Structure (Engineering Focus)
1. Hero: Service name + one-line value prop
2. Who it's for section
3. Problem/Solution block
4. Measurable outcomes (data-focused cards)
5. Step-by-step process visualization
6. Deliverables list (structured, not fluffy)
7. Timeline & expectations (honest)
8. Service-specific FAQ
9. CTA section

**Treatment**: Dark cards, generous spacing, editorial layout with images/diagrams where appropriate.

## Contact Page

### Qualification Form Design
- Clean, structured form layout
- Fields: Business name, Website, GBP link (optional), Location, Primary needs (multi-select chips), Budget range (dropdown), Timeline, Message
- NO: Generic "Get in Touch" headline
- YES: "Start a Conversation" or similar confident copy
- Form validation indicators (subtle, not aggressive)
- Dark form fields with glassy treatment

## Language Selector

- Visible at all times (likely header)
- DE/EN toggle or dropdown
- Persists choice (localStorage)
- Clean, minimal design—flag icons acceptable if tasteful

## Component Patterns

### Cards
- Glassy treatment with backdrop blur
- Subtle borders (rgba with low opacity)
- Rounded 2xl corners
- Hover: Slight scale or glow, not jump

### Buttons
- Primary: Cyan/teal accent with appropriate contrast
- Secondary: Outlined or ghost variant
- Sizing: Generous padding, clear hit areas
- Blur backgrounds when over images

### Navigation
- Clean header with minimal links
- Dark background, off-white text
- Active state clearly indicated
- Mobile: Sidebar or full-screen overlay (NOT hamburger cramped menu)

## Images

**Hero Section**: NO generic stock photos. If image used, prefer:
- Technical visualization
- Abstract geometric patterns
- Dark-themed custom graphics
- System diagram illustrations

**Service Pages**: Use diagrams, mockups, before/after comparisons where relevant

**Work Section**: Screenshots, data visualizations, process diagrams

## Responsive Behavior

- Desktop: Multi-column layouts, horizontal timelines
- Tablet: Adaptive 2-column grids
- Mobile: Single column, vertical stacks
- All breakpoints: Maintain generous spacing, never cramped

## Typography Scale Example
- H1: Large, bold (display scale)
- H2: Section headers (clear hierarchy)
- H3: Subsection headers
- Body: Comfortable reading size (16-18px equivalent)
- Small: Captions, meta info (subtle, not tiny)
