Build a Premium, Non-Generic, Bilingual Digital Agency Website (DE/EN – fully separated)
🔴 ABSOLUTE GRUNDREGEL (NICHT VERHANDELBAR)

This project must NOT result in a standard agency website.

No:

template-looking layouts

“hero + services + testimonials + footer” clichés

generic gradients + stock copy

marketing buzzwords without substance

This is a boutique, systems-driven digital partner website.
If any section looks generic, redesign it.

1️⃣ ROLE & RESPONSIBILITY

You are acting as:

Senior Web Architect

Senior Frontend Engineer

UX/UI Designer with product mindset

Your task is to design and implement a production-ready website that feels:

engineered, not marketed

calm, confident, precise

premium and modern

clearly differentiated from common agency sites

2️⃣ BUSINESS & POSITIONING (UNDERSTAND THIS FIRST)

We are a boutique digital partner, not a general agency.

Our core system:

Visibility → Conversion → Automation → Custom Engineering

What we offer (4 pillars, one system):

Local Growth
Google Business Profile, Local SEO, Maps & Local Pack visibility

Website Creation & Remodeling
Conversion-first websites, modern stacks, redesigns

AI Automations
Workflow automation, integrations, AI-assisted operations

Custom IT Services on Demand
Bespoke engineering, APIs, dashboards, data & scripts

These are not separate services, but interlocking layers.

3️⃣ LANGUAGE STRATEGY (CRITICAL – READ CAREFULLY)
❗ German and English are NOT translations

They are:

two separate market experiences

two different tones

two different copies

same structure, same codebase, different thinking

Rules:

User explicitly chooses language via selector

No browser detection

No auto redirect

No fallback

No shared copy

No translation keys

URLs:

/de/...

/en/...

Language switch:

visible at all times

persists via cookie or localStorage

switches route if exists, otherwise homepage of chosen language

4️⃣ CONTENT SEPARATION (MANDATORY)
Folder structure:
src/content/
  de/
    home.json
    services.json
    local-growth.json
    website.json
    ai-automations.json
    custom-it.json
    work.json
    about.json
    faq.json
  en/
    home.json
    services.json
    local-growth.json
    website.json
    ai-automations.json
    custom-it.json
    work.json
    about.json
    faq.json

Rules:

No shared strings

No translation logic

Locale decides which file is loaded

Same component, different content

5️⃣ TECH STACK (FIXED)

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript

TailwindCSS

shadcn/ui

Framer Motion

lucide-react

React Hook Form + Zod

next-intl (routing only, not translation keys)

Vercel-ready

Performance:

Lighthouse 90+ mobile

next/image everywhere

lazy loading

minimal JS

6️⃣ BRAND & UI SYSTEM (DEFINE IN CODE)
Visual Direction:

Dark, calm, technical

Near-black / deep navy base

Off-white text

One restrained accent (cyan/teal)

Soft gradients, glassy cards

Rounded 2xl, subtle shadows

Generous whitespace

Typography:

Strong headline scale

Calm body copy

No playful fonts

Feels “engineered”, not “marketed”

7️⃣ SITE STRUCTURE (SAME PAGES, DIFFERENT COPY)
Pages (DE & EN):

Home

Services (overview)

Local Growth

Website Creation & Remodeling

AI Automations

Custom IT on Demand

Work (real + simulated cases)

About

Contact

Legal (DE only: Impressum, Datenschutz)

8️⃣ HOMEPAGE – UNIQUE BLOCKS (NO STANDARD LAYOUT)

Build each as its own reusable block component.

A) Hero – System View

Headline: short, confident

Subheadline: explain the system (not buzzwords)

CTAs:

Primary: “Request a Map Audit” / “Book Discovery Call”

Right side:

Interactive System Loop Visual
(Visibility → Website → Automation → Custom IT)

Subtle motion only

B) Proof Without Bragging

Calm metric tiles (placeholders):

Map grid coverage

Conversion uplift

Hours saved via automation

No logos. No fake testimonials.

C) Four Pillars – Large, Editorial

Not icon boxes.

Each pillar:

short value statement

outcomes

link to detail page

D) Interactive Map Grid Demo

Keyword selector

City selector

Animated demo grid (frontend only)

Label clearly as “Demo visualization”

E) How We Work (Method, not sales)

Timeline:

Baseline & Audit

Build & Fix

Authority & Automation

Iterate & Measure

Expandable, factual, honest.

F) Work / Case Simulations

Show how you think

Include disclaimers

Styled like a report, not a blog

G) FAQ (Important)

Answer uncomfortable questions honestly:

No ranking guarantees

Timelines

Budget reality

Access requirements

Automation limits

H) Final CTA

Minimal.
Confident.
No pressure language.

9️⃣ SERVICE DETAIL PAGES (ENGINEERING, NOT MARKETING)

Each service page must include:

Who it’s for

What problem it solves

Outcomes (measurable)

Step-by-step process

Deliverables

Timeline & expectations

Service-specific FAQ

CTA

Special notes:

Local Growth: GBP, citations, grid strategy, reporting

Website: UX, performance, SEO, rebuilds, handover

AI Automations: workflows, integrations, AI components, monitoring

Custom IT: scoped help, APIs, dashboards, scripts, debugging

🔟 CONTACT PAGE (QUALIFY, NOT BEG)

Form fields:

Business name

Website

GBP link (optional)

Country / City

Primary need (multi-select)

Budget range

Timeline

Message

Validated with Zod.
API route placeholder only.

1️⃣1️⃣ SEO & STRUCTURED DATA

Separate metadata per locale

hreflang correctly set

Organization schema

Service schema per service page

FAQPage schema

Breadcrumb schema

Sitemap & robots
